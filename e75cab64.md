# `powerline-shell` for zsh

The [Powerline Shell](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell) is an excellent and good looking shell. It is easy to use it with `zsh`. Here are the steps:

1. Install `zsh` and `ohmyzsh`
2. Append the fragment referenced [here](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell#zsh) to your `~/.zshrc`.
3. [Generate a config](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell#config-file) if you intend to customise your shell components or theme.
